# fblike-post-localStorage

 - the user can register
 - the user can login 
 - the user can add friends (but friend acceptance is by default)
 - the user can add posts
 - when user adds a new friend (say A), even his(A's) posts would dislay in the current users timeline.
 - while adding the posts the post timer is also shown (increments every minute")
 - for the loggedin user, his posts and his friends posts are shown
 - All the data is "extensively" managed in local storage for now
 
 This is just a mini application for demo purposes
